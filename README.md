# 🏡 Housing Market Data Analysis: Pricing Trends & Predictive Insights

## 📖 Project Overview

This project explores and predicts housing market prices using Big Data Analysis techniques.
The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature correlation, predictive modeling, and dashboard visualization — providing insights into the factors that most strongly influence house prices.

This project was developed as part of my data analytics learning journey to demonstrate real-world data handling, modeling, and visualization skills.

## ⚙️ Objectives

1. Analyze key factors influencing housing prices

2. Identify patterns and correlations among property features

3. Build predictive models to estimate house prices

4. Visualize insights through an interactive dashboard

## 🧩 Tools & Technologies

Category	Tools Used
Programming Language	Python
Data Analysis Libraries	Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning	Scikit-learn
Visualization	Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Dashboarding	Plotly Subplots
Environment	Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights

1. Overall Quality and Living Area (GrLivArea) are the most impactful features in predicting sale price.

2. Houses with larger basements and garages tend to have higher market value.

3. The distribution of house prices is right-skewed, suggesting a majority of moderately priced homes with a few luxury outliers.

4. Linear Regression and Random Forest models both showed strong predictive performance for continuous value estimation.

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

The final interactive dashboard visualizes:

- Distribution of house prices

- Average sale price by quality

- Correlation heatmap of key variables

- Scatter plot of size vs price (with regression trendline)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
Model	Purpose	Result
Linear Regression	Baseline prediction model	Clear coefficient insights
Random Forest Regressor	Advanced ensemble model	Improved accuracy and feature ranking

## 📈 Results Summary

The trained models successfully predicted house prices with reasonable accuracy.

The dashboard highlights visual trends and correlations between property features and pricing.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analysis workflow, suitable for both academic and professional portfolio presentation.
